# WebApiTemplateEFCCF
Personal project to create a VS2019 project template for a Asp.Net Core WebApi application.

**Template for ASP.NET Core WebApi using EntityFramework Core Code First**

Unlike the default templates in VS, this template comes with EF Core, repository pattern and implemented CRUD functions and controller action methods.
With just a hand full of small changes it can be refactored to custom needs and remains operational.

It does, however, not contain generic implementations (not required right now).

**How to use**
Donwload and place in your local template folder. Select the template when creating a new project.
